User Authentication and Onboarding: First, we’ll implement a secure login system (using OAuth or multi-factor authentication) so each user can access their personalized dashboard. After sign-up, they input basic case info (like country, type of application) so we can tailor their experience.

Case Dashboard and Timeline: After onboarding, users see a dashboard with a visual timeline—showing key milestones like biometrics, interviews, and filing deadlines. Each milestone will display exact dates and requirements, so they know what to expect.

Document Checklist and Upload: We’ll provide a form checklist that dynamically adapts based on the user’s case type. Users can upload required documents (e.g., birth certificates, tax returns) with secure storage, and they’ll see a progress bar indicating what’s missing or completed.

Automated Deadline Alerts: Build a notification system (via email and SMS) that alerts users a few days before any critical deadlines, ensuring they never miss a key date.

Lawyer Review Module: After document submission, users can request a review. The lawyer team will get a notification, review the documents, and either approve them or send feedback. We’ll also track lawyer response times so clients know when to expect a review.

Monetization and Access Levels: We will include a subscription model so users pay monthly for premium tracking and lawyer access, or a pay-per-review model, depending on your preference. After the monetization model, we need a clear data flow structure: define how each user’s information is securely stored (encrypted in transit and at rest). We’ll also specify how the document verification workflow works: once a user uploads a file, it triggers a validation queue for your team. We’ll map out who sees what: admin roles for your team, user roles for clients, and a review queue. Next, we need a reporting module—so you get analytics on how many cases are processed, how long reviews take, and which steps users struggle with most. And, let’s make sure we include scalability—so the system can handle a growing number of users and cases without lag. Once we have all of that, we can break down each module into tasks, assign owners, set milestones, and begin implementation
First, in Phase 1, we’ll design the UX/UI: wireframes for the dashboard, checklist, and document upload screens. Phase 2 will be backend setup: user authentication, data models for cases and documents, and secure storage integration. Phase 3 is where we add the timeline logic and notifications—so each step triggers reminders. Phase 4 is the lawyer review workflow: set up a review queue, permissions, and feedback forms. Phase 5 is testing: we run end-to-end tests on uploads, deadlines, and lawyer reviews. Phase 6 is deployment and scaling: we monitor performance, optimize for traffic, and handle future updates. With this phased approach, we’ll keep everything organized, ensuring each element is built, tested, and scaled properly.
